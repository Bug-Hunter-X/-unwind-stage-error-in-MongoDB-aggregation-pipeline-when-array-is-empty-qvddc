This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the $unwind stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. Specifically, it highlights the issue of handling empty arrays in the $unwind stage, which can cause pipeline failures. The `bug.js` file illustrates the problem and the `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using the $lookup and $unwind operator with conditional logic to bypass the error.
